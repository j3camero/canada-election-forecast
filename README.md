The 2019 election model is a spreadsheet. [Check it out here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UEOsdId5l3m-Vir8jDzfCUJcH_0NBddIB5dRQ3x1JoA/edit?usp=sharing)!

It is simpler because there was no re-districting to account for. Most of the code in here has to do with the 2015 election which had a re-districting.

The 2019 website is in archive/. You should be able to open it locally on your own computer if you want to!
